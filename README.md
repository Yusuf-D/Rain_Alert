# Rain_Alert

This is a python code that checks if a rain is expected in a particular time interval, then sends an SMS via Twilio.
Weather condition information is taken from https://api.openweathermap.org.
You should enter your own account id's and your own coordinates in terms of longitude and latitude.

Also via this website (https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) you can schedule a daily task and run your code everyday at 07.00 am.
